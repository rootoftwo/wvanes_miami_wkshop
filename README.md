Locust Projects presents the U.S. premiere of Whithervanes, a neurotic, early worrying system featuring four-foot tall internet-connected headless chickens by Detroit-based experimental design duo rootoftwo (Cezanne Charles and John Marshall). Perched on rooftops around the city, these 21st century weathervanes scan the Internet for alarmist keywords changing direction and color in response to the climate of fear propagated by the media. Designed to be interactive via social media, the public can add to the escalation of fear or attempt to counteract it by sending the messages to @whithervanes using either #keepcalm or #skyfalling. The presentation of Whithervanes in Miami is a Knight Foundation-funded project.

Spending much of our lives connected digitally, we are as affected by the ‘weather’ on the Internet as in the sky. This project tracks the orchestration of fear in real time through monitoring newsfeeds for alarmist keywords. 

These headless chicken weathervanes revolve away from the geographic origin of news stories, indicating the intensity of fear through changing colored lighting and the number of rotations each Whithervane makes.

Community Engagement: 
The confluence of big data, algorithms and artificial intelligence/deep learning systems is a seismic shift challenging all aspects of public and private life. Because this shift is both pervasive and almost imperceptible, the Whithervanes project was developed to call attention to the way it shapes and distorts news and information, ensuring exposure to media that conforms to existing ideas and worldviews.

rootoftwo invites Miami residents to add words and phrases used to fine tune and localize the Whithervanes project by participating in free workshops. The workshops are designed for participants 14 and older and provide the opportunity to learn basic physical computing and programming skills for controlling light and motion using microcontrollers, LEDs and motors (no soldering required). Past workshops have included a mix of students, young professionals, and adult learners interested in visual arts, design, technology, and media. The workshops include an artist presentation and facilitated dialogue sessions. The workshops are an essential part of the project’s evolution and inspired the development of the Whithervanes Open Hardware Kit.

From Public Art to Public Platform: 
rootoftwo is developing the Whithervanes Open Hardware Kit (WOHK) to sit at the nexus of ideas surrounding the mediation of public and private space and the evolving nature of the networked city. The kit allows users to repurpose other data sources aside from Reuters, develop their own library of keywords to drive behavior, and learn basic coding and interactivity.

The kit will be available as an Internet of Things product and also as an open-source toolkit for the design and fabrication of personal versions of the sculptures and an open-source license and repository for the code. WOHK is targeted to hackers, makers, citizen journalists, journalists, media activists, designers, artists and tinkerers that want to visualize big data and make meaning.

We imagine any number of other groups and individuals could build on this system to make evident a variety of concerns.

rootoftwo: 
Cézanne Charles + John Marshall founded and co-direct the hybrid design studio, rootoftwo in 1998. They make art and design experiences for the public realm. Their works specifically attempt to disrupt and undermine existing systems through humor, play, interaction and participation. Their works create a condition where the here and now, and the future can be perceived differently.
